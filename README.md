# Transaction Monitoring Analysis

This project analyzes modern approaches to transaction monitoring for financial crime detection, based on academic literature and industry practices.

## Project Overview

We are examining three main approaches to transaction monitoring:

1. Decision Trees
2. Neural Networks
3. Statistical Profiling

## Current Status

- Completed initial literature review of Bolton & Hand (2002) and Levy (2003)
- Implemented basic visualization of transaction patterns
- Analyzed strengths and weaknesses of different approaches

## Next Steps

1. Deep dive into neural network implementation for transaction monitoring
2. Explore decision tree rule generation
3. Implement statistical profiling examples
4. Develop integrated approach combining multiple methods
